This module adds the possibility to flag some products to be sold only to
specific customers. The selection is done on the Sale tab of the product
form.

Note
----
This module has been proposed on odoo-shopinvader repository by this
`PR <https://github.com/shopinvader/odoo-shopinvader/pull/722>`_.
But refused because it contains Odoo business logic.

Roadmap
-------

Split this into two module one for the Odoo business logic in OCA and another
one implementing the export to Shopinvader.
